\# Purpose
This application is a social platform for tracking and sharing progress in personal passions and creative pursuits. Unlike fitness or productivity trackers, it emphasizes meaningful, project-based activities such as woodworking, reading, and writing. The app enables users to capture updates, share evidence of progress, and connect with others who share similar interests.
